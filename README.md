# 🛠️ GearGuard – Maintenance Tracker
“GearGuard is a maintenance tracking system that connects equipment, maintenance teams, and maintenance requests.
Each equipment is registered with its technical and ownership details and linked to a responsible maintenance team.
When an issue occurs, a maintenance request is created and managed through a Kanban workflow from New to Repaired or Scrap.
The system supports both corrective and preventive maintenance activities.
We implemented the database using both MySQL and SQLite to ensure flexibility during development and testing.
The overall workflow and interface follow the provided mockup design.”
