# 🛠️ GearGuard – Maintenance Tracker
“GearGuard is a maintenance tracking system that connects equipment, maintenance teams, and maintenance requests.
Each piece of equipment is registered with its department, location, and responsible team.
When an issue occurs, a corrective maintenance request is created and managed through a Kanban workflow from New to Repaired or Scrap.
For routine checks, preventive maintenance requests are scheduled and shown in a calendar view.
The system provides clear visibility of maintenance status and responsibility.
Our database is implemented using SQLite with structured relational tables, and the UI workflow follows the given mockup design.”
